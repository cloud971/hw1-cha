<h1>Project 1</h1><br/>The following Project calculates the 
lcm,gcd,sum and product of given numbers. If no numbers
are given then the output would be 0. If only one number is given then the output is that number

<h2>GCD</h2>
To find the GCD of numbers run the following:<br/><br/>
$calc gcd 1 2 3 4<br/>
$1<br/>

<h2>Sum</h2>
To find the sum of numbers run the following:<br/><br/>
$calc sum 1 2 3 4<br/>
$10<br/>

<h2>LCD</h2>
To find the LCD of numbers run the following:<br/><br/>
$calc lcd 1 2 3 4<br/>
$1<br/>

<h2>Prodcut</h2>
To find the product of numbers run the following:<br/><br/>
$calc product 1 2 3 4<br/>
$24<br/>

<h2>No Arguments</h2>
Output with no arguments<br/>
$calc sum<br/>
$0<br/>

<h2>One Argument</h2>
Output with one argument only<br/>
$calc sum 4<br/>
$4<br/>

<h1>Test</h1>
To test the program run the following command:<br/>
$cargo test<br/>
All the test should pass<br/>

<h1>Results</h1>
All of the following test cases passed. Unit test were written for each functionality of the project.<br/>
The project succesfully calculated lcm,gcd,product and sum of given numbers.
